# Mac App Store Submission Guide for MyMacCleaner

## Overview

This document outlines the process to submit MyMacCleaner to the Mac App Store. Due to mandatory sandboxing requirements, this requires creating a **limited "App Store Edition"** that runs alongside the existing full-featured direct distribution.

---

## The Trade-off

| Distribution | Features | Reach |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Direct (current)** | 100% - Full Disk Access, all cleaning | GitHub/Website users |
| **App Store (new)** | ~30-40% - User files only | Millions of Mac users |

**Recommendation:** Maintain both. The App Store version serves as marketing/discovery to drive users to the full version.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Apple Developer Setup

#### 1.1 Create App Store Distribution Certificate
1. Go to [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
2. Certificates → Create → "Apple Distribution"
3. Download and install in Keychain

#### 1.2 Create App Store Provisioning Profile
1. Profiles → Create → "Mac App Store"
2. Select App ID: `com.mymaccleaner.MyMacCleaner`
3. Select your Apple Distribution certificate
4. Download and install

#### 1.3 Register App in App Store Connect
1. Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. My Apps → "+" → New App
3. Platform: macOS
4. Bundle ID: `com.mymaccleaner.MyMacCleaner`
5. Name: "MyMacCleaner" (or "MyMacCleaner Lite" if keeping names distinct)

---

### Phase 2: Create App Store Build Configuration

#### 2.1 Create Sandboxed Entitlements File

Create `MyMacCleaner/MyMacCleaner-AppStore.entitlements`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### 2.2 Add App Store Build Configuration in Xcode

1. Open Project Settings → Info tab
2. Under "Configurations", click "+" and duplicate "Release"
3. Name it "Release-AppStore"
4. For the MyMacCleaner target in Release-AppStore:
   - Set `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` = `MyMacCleaner/MyMacCleaner-AppStore.entitlements`
   - Set `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` = `Apple Distribution`
   - Set `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` = `Automatic`
   - Add `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` = `APPSTORE_BUILD`

#### 2.3 Create App Store Scheme
1. Product → Scheme → Manage Schemes
2. Duplicate "MyMacCleaner" scheme
3. Name: "MyMacCleaner-AppStore"
4. Edit scheme → Archive → Build Configuration: "Release-AppStore"

---

### Phase 3: Code Changes for Sandbox Compatibility

#### 3.1 Add Feature Detection

Create `Core/Services/AppDistribution.swift`:

```swift
enum AppDistribution {
    static var isAppStore: Bool {
        #if APPSTORE_BUILD
        return true
        #else
        return false
        #endif
    }
}
```

#### 3.2 Disable Unsupported Features in App Store Build

Add `#if !APPSTORE_BUILD` guards to:

| File | What to Hide |
|------|-------------|
| `ContentView.swift` | Hide navigation sections: Orphaned Files, Port Management, Startup Items, Permissions |
| `HomeView.swift` | Hide FDA prompts, permission banners |
| `DiskCleanerView.swift` | Hide system caches, Xcode cleanup categories |
| `PerformanceView.swift` | Hide maintenance tab, purge cache button |
| `ApplicationsView.swift` | Hide homebrew tab, uninstall functionality |
| `AppCard.swift` | Hide uninstall button |
| `MyMacCleanerApp.swift` | Conditionally disable Sparkle, menu bar |

Example pattern:
```swift
#if !APPSTORE_BUILD
// Direct distribution only code
PermissionBanner(permissionsService: PermissionsService.shared)
#endif
```

#### 3.3 Conditionally Disable Sparkle

In `MyMacCleanerApp.swift`:
```swift
#if !APPSTORE_BUILD
import Sparkle
@State private var updateManager = UpdateManager()
#endif
```

---

### Phase 4: App Store Metadata

#### 4.1 Required Assets
- **App Icon**: Already have (1024x1024 in Assets.xcassets)
- **Screenshots**: 5-10 at 1280x800 or 1440x900 minimum
- **Preview Video**: Optional (15-30 seconds)

#### 4.2 App Store Description

#### 4.3 Category and Keywords
- **Category**: Utilities
- **Keywords**: cleaner, disk, space, cache, cleanup, optimizer, mac

### Phase 5: Build and Upload

#### 5.1 Create Export Options Plist

Create `ExportOptions-AppStore.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>YOUR_TEAM_ID</string>
    <key>signingStyle</key>
    <string>automatic</string>
    <key>uploadSymbols</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### 5.2 Archive for App Store

```bash
xcodebuild archive \
    -project MyMacCleaner.xcodeproj \
    -scheme "MyMacCleaner-AppStore" \
    -configuration Release-AppStore \
    -archivePath build/MyMacCleaner-AppStore.xcarchive
```

#### 5.3 Export for App Store

```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
    -archivePath build/MyMacCleaner-AppStore.xcarchive \
    -exportPath build/AppStore \
    -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions-AppStore.plist
```

#### 5.4 Upload
- **Via Xcode**: Window → Organizer → Select archive → Distribute App → App Store Connect
- **Via Transporter**: Download from Mac App Store, drag & drop the .pkg

---

### Phase 6: Submit for Review

1. In App Store Connect, select the uploaded build
2. Complete all required metadata
3. Answer export compliance questions (typically "No" for encryption)
4. Submit for review

## Notes

- Keep both distribution channels: Direct (full features) and App Store (limited)
- Use App Store as discovery/marketing to drive users to the full version
- Consider adding an "Upgrade to Full Version" link in the App Store edition
- Test thoroughly in sandbox before submitting to avoid rejection
